## 🎯 **Project Objective**

To design and prototype a **conversion-focused, operationally realistic booking flow** for a hyperlocal logistics service including:

✔ Pickup & Drop address entry  
✔ Vehicle & package selection  
✔ Dynamic pricing & order summary  
✔ Checkout with form validation  
✔ Booking confirmation with next-step guidance

## 🧩 **Booking Flow Screens**

| **Step** | **Screen Name** | **Purpose** |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Pickup & Drop Details** | Enter & validate delivery addresses |
| **2** | **Vehicle & Package Selection** | Choose suitable delivery vehicle |
| **3** | **Pricing & Order Summary** | Fare breakdown & edit previous steps |
| **4** | **Checkout** | Sender & Receiver details with validation |
| **5** | **Booking Confirmation** | Success state with tracking options |

## ⚙️ **Setup Steps**

To view the prototype:

1. Open the **Prototype link**  
2. See Video   
3. Test validation by entering valid & invalid inputs  

> No installations required — this is a UI prototype.

## 🧠 **UX Assumptions**

- Users book **same-day hyperlocal deliveries**  
- Service area limited to **Mumbai city**  
- Express delivery available on serviceable routes  
- Package size & weight determine vehicle suitability  
- Pricing updates dynamically based on selections  

---

## ⚡ **Edge Cases Implemented**

✅ **Express vs Normal Delivery Clarity**  
Price difference shown clearly.

✅ **Unserviceable Address Handling**  
Invalid locations (e.g., Powai Lake, Marine Drive) show guidance & disable Next.

✅ **Dynamic Price Update**  
Fare updates after changing vehicle or package details.

✅ **Edit Previous Steps Retains State**  
Users can go back without losing entered data.

✅ **Form Validation Before Confirmation**  
Sender & Receiver details validated before booking.

## 💰 **Consistent Demo Booking Data Example**

**Pickup:** Andheri East, Mumbai  
**Drop-off:** Linking Road, Bandra  
**Distance:** ~4.2 km  
**ETA:** 25–35 mins  
**Service:** Express Delivery  
**Package:** Fragile Items (12 kg)  
**Vehicle:** Bike (default)

### **Fare Breakdown**

| **Charge Type** | **Amount** |
|-----------------|------------|
| Base Fare | ₹120 |
| Distance Charge | ₹30 |
| Express Charge | ₹50 |
| **Total Fare** | **₹200** |

> **No hidden charges — consistent across all screens**
